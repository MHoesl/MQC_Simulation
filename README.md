# MQC Simulation

Multi quantum coherences (MQC) simulation, simulates Phase Cycle Choices for a three-pulses sequence, typically used in Sodium TQ acquisitions in Nucelar Magnetic Rensonance (NRM) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).


Tested with Matlab_R2017


## Usage

```matlab 

Scripts are called Explore... , use them to see how the functions act on the different phase cycle options that were chosen for 23Na MRI/NMR.
